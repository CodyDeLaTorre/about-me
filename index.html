        <p class="info">
          My name is Cody De La torre, I am 23 and I was born and raised in sunny southern California. I was a menace as a child but when I graduated high school I joined the US Army as an Intelligence Analyst which got me on the right track. I've served my time in the Army and now I am ready to move on to new challenges and that's why I'm here with y'all at Code Fellows!
